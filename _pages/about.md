I’m a first-year PhD student in Statistics at [Columbia University](https://stat.columbia.edu/). My research interests broadly span the theory and practice of modern machine learning, including uncertainty quantification, generalization in deep learning, and the statistical foundations of AI. I’m especially interested in how ideas from high-dimensional statistics, optimization, and Bayesian inference can inform the design and understanding of scalable learning systems.

Previously, I studied Computer Science and Mathematics at UC Berkeley, where I worked with [Professor Shankar Sastry](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/sastry.html) on computer vision and robotics. Most recently, I’ve been exploring how to model dynamic interactions in competitive environments, such as table tennis, using generative modeling and policy inference from real-world video.

Outside of research, I enjoy backpacking, learning languages (currently Farsi), and playing basketball.
